# Awesome Books

The purpose of this project is to introduce us to Javascript while adding and modifying elements of DOM.

## Project specifications

    Create a collection that keeps a list of books (hint: you can use an array of objects for that).
    Create a function to add a new book to the collection, with title and author.
    Create a function to remove a book from the collection (hint: you can use the array filter() method).
    Display all books saved in the collection in the top part of the page.
    Make sure that when a user clicks the "Add" button:
        A new book is added to the collection.
        The new book is displayed in the page.
    Make sure that when a user clicks the "Remove" button:
        The correct book is removed from the collection.
        The correct book dissapears from the page.
    Make sure that data is preserved in the browser's memory by using localStorage.
    To debug your application, you can use console.log(). Remember to remove debugging code before pushing your code to the remote repository.
    Don't use any library or framework, use only plain JavaScript.
    You need to use pair-programming for this project. We will check to see if both partners submitted code by looking at the commit history for each project. Therefore you need to use only one repository for your pair-programming group.
